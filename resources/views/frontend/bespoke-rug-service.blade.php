                        <p>We work with a number of rug houses and fabric designers, based in the UK, providing a bespoke rug design and manaufacturing service.</p>

                        <p>We spend the majority of our time based in Nepal where the rugs are produced and are therefore able to provide a very personal service, and on-site quality inspection for the clients that we help produce bespoke rugs for. We have very close and friendly working relationships with the rug factories and artisans that we have chosen to work with and are able to 'get things done' on behalf of our clients in an efficient manner.</p>

                        <p>For interior designers in the UK, we are represented by <a href="http://www.timpagecarpets.com/" target="_blank" class="mp-hov-link">Tim Page Carpets</a>, based on the ground floor in Design Centre Chelsea Harbour, London and where are number of our samples are available to review.</p>

                        <p>For rug designers and suppliers, we are very happy to have a discussion with regarding the service that we can provide and are in the UK for various meetings every couple of months.</p>

                        <p>We have the following ARS colour pom boxes: ARS-600 wool, ARS-1200 wool and ARS-700 viscose. However we additionally have our own colour pom chart, which can be purchased upon request.</p>

                        <p>Lead times are generally 12 weeks for 200 x 300 cms, 16 weeks for 300 x 400 cms.</p>

                        <p>Lead times can be reduced at additional cost.</p>

                        <p>With a working relationship and fee structure agreements in place, we will be happy to provide CAD renderings of specified designs and suggest the materials that would work best for a design and budget of the ultimate client.</p>

                        <p>We can work with photos or design inspiration images of patterns that you may have seen and are normally able to  interpret most ideas.</p>
